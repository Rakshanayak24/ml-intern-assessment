This is an example corpus for the trigram assignment. It contains a few sentences to get you started.
You can extend it with additional technical content, product descriptions, or research summaries if you want a larger training dataset.

Modern software projects rely on clean architecture, reliable APIs, and scalable backend services. Developers use automation tools, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines to maintain smooth deployment workflows. Good engineering habits such as writing modular code and maintaining clear documentation contribute to long-term project stability.

Artificial intelligence plays a major role in modern product development. Machine learning models improve user experience, automate repetitive tasks, and extract insights from large datasets. Building robust AI systems involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and continuous monitoring pipelines.

Natural language processing has advanced rapidly with transformer architectures and generative models. Applications such as summarization, classification, and conversational agents depend on high-quality textual data. Even simple n-gram models help demonstrate the fundamentals of statistical language generation.

This corpus provides a clean, domain-relevant foundation for experimenting with trigrams. You can expand it further with technical content, product descriptions, engineering workflows, or research summaries. Good luck with your experiment!
